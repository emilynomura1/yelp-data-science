# Yelp Data Science Project

This project is a reproducible data science project that analyzes profile data of anyone with a personal Yelp account.

To download your data:
1. Sign into Yelp
2. Navigate to *Profile > Account Settings > Privacy Settings*
3. Click "Download a copy of your Yelp data"

For privacy purposes, I have not included any of my personal Yelp account data. Thus, to reproduce this project, you must download your own data and move the relevant HTML files into a `data` folder in the root directory of your repository.
